My homework focus on the Lab1. Only the based task was done, but the performance is not very good as well. 

2 .ipynb files can be found in the folder called "Lab1 sobel". They process 2 different pixel images respectively, whose information of pixel can be found at the name of the .ipynb file.

As you see, the processed image in the "sobel_part3_100x64.ipynb" has a great effect, while the processed image in the "sobel_part3_200x128.ipynb" is not the case. When it processed the image by vitis vision library, something wrong happened and the reason is still unclear.

Additionally, I tried my best to accomplish the advanced task, which requires process the image by "resize", "cvtcolor" operator in vitis vision library. But I cannot connect the IP core correctly when I creat Block Design in Vivado. I will continue to research it.

Thanks for your reading.
